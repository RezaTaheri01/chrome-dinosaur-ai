# Chrome Dinosaur with NEAT AI(pre-alpha)

This project is a Chrome Dinosaur clone built with Python and Pygame, featuring both a player-controlled mode and an AI mode powered by the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.

## Features

- **Player Mode:** Control the Dino manually using the keyboard up and down.
- **AI Mode:** Train an AI to play Chrome Dinosaur using NEAT.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RezaTaheri01/chrome-dinosaur-ai.git
```
```
cd chrome-dinosaur-ai
```

2. Install the required packages:

```sh
pip install pygame neat-python
```

3. Set up the project structure:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ Assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Bird
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cactus
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dino

â”œâ”€â”€ config-feedforward.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ ai.py
â””â”€â”€ main.py

```

## How to Run

- **Player Mode:**

```sh
python main.py
```

- **AI Mode:**
  
```sh
python ai.py
```

## Controls

- **UP and Down:** Make the Dino Jump or Duck

## NEAT Configuration

The NEAT algorithm's settings are in the `config-feedforward.txt` file. You can tweak parameters like population size, mutation rates, and more to optimize training.

## Saving the Best Model

When the AI reaches a specific score(defined in src/constants.py), the best-performing neural network is saved as `best.pickle`.
